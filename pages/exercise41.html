        In his search for the “world’s best driving road” Jeremy Clarkson declared that he had found it in the middle of Romania – in the form of the Transfagarasan highway. Whichever way you look at it, it is an extraordinary feat of engineering: a stretch of tarmac packed with tunnels, viaducts and bridges and which takes the skill of navigating hairpin bends to new heights. The road was another Ceaușescu creation. He wanted to ensure that in the event of a Soviet invasion there was a speedy way of escaping through the strategic (and scenic) mountain passes of the Southern Carpathians (not that it was ever used for that purpose).

        In Sacha Baron Cohen’s film, scene’s purporting to show Borat’s Kazakh hometown were shot in the village of Glod, Romania, while its Roma residents were cast as extras. Those same extras later took (unsuccessful) legal action claiming they were unaware of the film’s subject matter.

        Other films shot in Romania include Cold Mountain and, er, Anaconda III starring David Hasselhoff.

        Romania’s Merry Cemetery, located in Săpânța, Maramureş County, is the world’s most colorful graveyard. It started one day when a very talented local craftsman, Stan Ioan Pătraş, started using his creativity to make colorful wooden crosses which he painted with poems about the lives of his customers.
        A walk in the Săpânța Merry Cemetery will delight you visually as well as challenge you to meditate on the transient nature of life. In particular, pay attention to the symbols hidden in the colorful palette. Green is used to mean life, yellow represents fertility, red signifies passion and black represents death.
